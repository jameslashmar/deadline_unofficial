Unofficially patched submissions scripts for Cinema4D &amp; Deadline


This is the official MographDotCom Slack (Thinkxbox Unofficial) repo for Deadline patched submission scripts to keep Deadline working with Maxon Cinema4D updates.

We may expand to include Houdini etc, but it is out of scope for the time being.

Simply copy the deadline folder for your C4D version and paste it over the top of the files in your repo. Done.
